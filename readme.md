## :question: What is this Repository about?

- This repository contains the example code for running Mobile Biometric Authentication automation tests for 
Android using [Appium 2.0](https://appium.github.io/appium/docs/en/2.0/intro/) on Android Emulator and 
Real Devices on LambdaTest Cloud platform
- [WebdriverIO Demo Native App](https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app/releases/tag/v0.4.0) is used for running 
biometric authentication test on Android Emulator 
- Instrumentation app by LambdaTest is used as a demo mobile application for running biometric authentication tests on Real Devices
- This repo uses `Maven` as build tool and `TestNG` testing framework to run the tests
- Android application Tests are run on [LambdaTest Cloud grid](http://www.lambdatest.com?fp_ref=faisal58) on Real Android Devices

## Talking more about the Scenarios Covered in this project:

I have tried to answer the below questions by providing working code example in this repo:

1. How to run biometric authentication automation tests using Appium and LambdaTest Cloud grid
2. How to run biometric authentication automation tests using Appium on Android Emulators

## How to run the Tests?

### Pre-Requisite:

- JAVA JDK 17 should be installed
- Android Studio should be installed with an Emulator that has the biometric option configured
- An Account should be available on [LambdaTest Cloud grid](http://www.lambdatest.com?fp_ref=faisal58) with a plan to run automated mobile tests

- Run the tests using `TestNG`:

  Right click on `test-suite\testng.xml` and select `Run test-suite\testng.xml`

- Run the tests using `Maven`:

  `mvn clean install`
